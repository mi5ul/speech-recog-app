This app uses [IBM Watson Speech to Text API](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/speech-to-text/) to convert recorded voice and then translates it to an Australian lingo using the [Fun Translations API](http://funtranslations.com/#). The authentication server for the Watson API is hosted on IBM Cloud.
